# PISM

The Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM) is open source and capable of high resolution. It has been [widely adopted as a tool for doing
science](publications).

Features include:

 * extensible atmospheric/ocean coupling
 * hybrid shallow stress balance
 * marine ice sheet physics
 * polythermal energy conservation
 * subglacial hydrology and till model
 * complete [documentation](overview)
 * parallel simulations using [MPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface) & [PETSc](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/)
 * reads and writes [CF-compliant](http://cfconventions.org/) [NetCDF](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/)
 * [inversion toolbox in Python](http://www.pism-docs.org/doxy/inverse/html/index.html)
 * verification and validation tools

## Team

PISM is jointly developed at the [University of Alaska, Fairbanks (UAF)](http://www.uaf.edu/) and the [Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK)](http://www.pik-potsdam.de/). For more about the team see the [Developer Team](team) page.

UAF developers, who are in the [Glaciers Group at the GI](https://glaciers.gi.alaska.edu), are supported by NASA's [Modeling, Analysis, and Prediction](http://map.nasa.gov/) and [Cryospheric Sciences](http://ice.nasa.gov/) Programs (grants NAG5-11371, NNX09AJ38C, NNX13AM16G, NNX16AQ40G, NNX17AG65G) and by NSF grants PLR-1603799 and PLR-1644277.
